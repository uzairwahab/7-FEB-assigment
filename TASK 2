Q1. You are writing code for a company. The requirement of the company is that you create a python
function that will check whether the password entered by the user is correct or not. The function should
take the password as input and return the string “Valid Password” if the entered password follows the
below-given password guidelines else it should return “Invalid Password”.
Note: 1. The Password should contain at least two uppercase letters and at least two lowercase letters.
2. The Password should contain at least a number and three special characters.
3. The length of the password should be 10 characters long.
ANS. 

def check_password(password):
    # Check length of password
    if len(password) != 10:
        return "Invalid Password"
    # Check if password contains at least two uppercase letters and two lowercase letters
    if not (re.search("[A-Z]{2,}", password) and re.search("[a-z]{2,}", password)):
        return "Invalid Password"
    # Check if password contains at least one number and three special characters
    if not (re.search("\d", password) and re.search("[!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|:;'<>,.?/]{3,}", password)):
        return "Invalid Password"
    # If all conditions are met, return "Valid Password"
    return "Valid Password"






Q2. Solve the below-given questions using at least one of the following:
1. Lambda function
2. Filter function
3. Map function
4. List Comprehension

. Check if the string starts with a particular letter


. Check if the string is numeric


. Sort a list of tuples having fruit names and their quantity. [("mango",99),("orange",80), ("grapes", 1000)


. Find the squares of numbers from 1 to 10
ans. l = list(range(1,11))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

def sq(x):
    return x**2
list(map(sq , l))

. Find the cube root of numbers from 1 to 10

Ans. l1 = list(range(1,11))
     def cube(x):
      return x**3

list(map(cube, l1))
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000] 


. Check if a given number is even
. Filter odd numbers from the given list.
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
. Sort a list of integers into positive and negative integers lists.
[1,2,3,4,5,6,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,0]
